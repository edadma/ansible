# ansible
This repo is intended to be pulled by `ansible-pull` to do a workstation setup. It works for Ubuntu 2020.

1) install ansible, and runtime dependencies: `sudo apt install ansible git python3-distutils`
2) run `sudo ansible-pull -U https://github.com/edadma/ansible.git`
3) should see `failed=0` somewhere in the last line of output
